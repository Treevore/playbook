# Digital Services Playbook

The University of Michigan faculty, students, and staff expect to interact with their library through digital channels such as websites, email, and web-based applications. By building digital services that meet their needs, we can make the delivery of our mission and resources more effective.

Today, too many of our digital services projects do not work well, are delivered late, or are poorly resourced. To increase the success rate of these projects, we need a new approach. We created a playbook of 13 key “plays” drawn from successful practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together, will help us to build effective digital services.
